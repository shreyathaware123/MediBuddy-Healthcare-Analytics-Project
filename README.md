# 🏥 MediBuddy Healthcare Analytics Project

### Python (EDA & Business Insights) + Excel Analysis

This project analyzes healthcare and insurance-related data inspired by MediBuddy, a digital healthcare platform specializing in inpatient, outpatient, and corporate wellness benefits.

The objective of this project is to explore health-related risk factors and understand how demographic and lifestyle attributes influence medical insurance costs and policy risk segmentation.

# 💹 Project Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate business insights that help:

* Identify high-risk policyholders
* Understand cost-driving factors in health insurance
* Analyze impact of BMI and smoking on medical expenses
* Support premium pricing and risk classification decisions
  
# 📂 Dataset Overview

The project uses two datasets:

### Dataset 1: Health Metrics

* Age
* BMI (Body Mass Index)
  (Collected during pre-policy health checkup)

### Dataset 2: Personal & Lifestyle Details

* Number of children
* Smoking status (Yes/No)
* Residential region
* Additional demographic details

The datasets were merged and cleaned using Python for analysis.

# 💹 Tools & Technologies Used

### 🐍 Python

* Pandas (Data Cleaning & Merging)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Correlation Analysis

### 📊 Excel

* Data Structuring
* Summary Tables
* KPI Analysis
* Risk Segmentation

# 💹 Key Analysis & Insights

## 🔹 Impact of Smoking on Medical Costs

* Smokers show significantly higher medical expenses compared to non-smokers.
* Smoking status is one of the strongest predictors of insurance cost.

## 🔹 BMI vs Charges

* Higher BMI levels correlate with increased medical expenses.
* Obesity category policyholders contribute disproportionately to total claims.

## 🔹 Age vs Charges

* Medical expenses increase with age.
* Older individuals fall into higher cost brackets due to higher health risk.

## 🔹 Regional Distribution

* Certain regions show slightly higher average claims.
* Geographic segmentation can assist in pricing strategies.

## 🔹 Number of Children

* Families with more dependents tend to show moderately higher overall costs.

# 📈 Business Insights

This analysis helps insurance providers:

* Identify high-risk customer segments
* Optimize premium pricing models
* Improve underwriting decisions
* Design targeted wellness programs
* Reduce claim-related financial risk

Key Finding:
Smoking and BMI are major cost drivers, making lifestyle-based premium differentiation a strategic opportunity.

# 💡 Business Impact

This project demonstrates how data-driven analysis can:

* Improve risk classification
* Reduce claim losses
* Enhance policy pricing accuracy
* Support preventive healthcare initiatives

The insights can be directly used for underwriting strategies and corporate health benefit structuring.
